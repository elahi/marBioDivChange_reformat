# questions for jillian

- I relabeled my 'soft bottom subtidal' as jd's 'subtidal mudflat'
- I did not use 'estuarine mudflat', only 'subtidal mudflat'

- Does site size refer to the 'extent', or the total amount of area sampled per site 

- Do you want to include both sample and site scale data for datasets that have both (e.g.,
LTER, LTER, Birkeland)?  You can filter the data as needed.  Note that some studies only 
have data at gamma scales, so don't filter simply by excluding gamma. 

- plot number depends on site, and i have it listed as a range - if you need the correct
number of plots per site, we will need to go through the data
